# Scramble Solver

This program was built to solve Zynga's original Scramble With Friends game (now Word Streak with Friends) by providing a list of all the words that can be made in the game sorted by the total amount of points that word would give you.  In this game, users are given a 4x4 grid of letters where each letter has a point value.  Word values are the sum of their letter values.
